        <h1>Reflected Xss</h1>
        <p>Reflectedxss is a type of XSS where the malicious code is reflected off the server and is executed when the victim visits the page.
        Reflectedxss is also known as Persistent XSS.
        Reflectedxss is more dangerous than Reflected XSS because the malicious code is reflected off the server and can be executed multiple times.
        Reflectedxss is also more difficult to detect than Reflected XSS.
        Reflectedxss can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, carry out phishing attacks, or perform drive-by-downloads.
        Reflectedxss can be prevented by sanitizing user input and encoding output.</p>
